# React Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the React Tic Tac Toe project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalraj8/tic-tac-toe--React

### Project Structure

* src: Contains the source code of the React app.

* src/components: Contains React components used in the app.

* src/App.js: The main component that renders the Tic Tac Toe game.

* public: Contains static assets and the HTML file where the React app is mounted


### Game Rules

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns to place their "X" or "O" on an empty square.
* The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If the board is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
